# nodejs-web-server
A web server template written with Node.js with a simple web front-end template. The web server can work as a reverse proxy when there are backend services.

How to start up the server:

1. Download (clone) the source files.
2. Open a command prompt in the project directory.
3. Do one of the following two options.
    - Run `node server.js`. (Node.js needs to be installed.)
    - Run `docker compose up`. (Docker needs to be installed.)
4. Access `http://localhost:49152` in your browser.

Pressing the GET button or the POST button will send a GET/POST request to the web server and shows the results on the page.
